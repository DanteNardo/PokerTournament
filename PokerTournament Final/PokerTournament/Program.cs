     * Kevin Bierre  Spring 2017
     * 
     * Version 3    4/4/2017:
     *  Corrected a logic error when folding
     *  Corrected a logic error in processing a call correctly
     *  
     * Version 4    4/4/2017
     *  Corrected a logic error where the pot was not being reset in a couple of cases
     *  Corrected the handling of calls during betting. If a player calls,
     *      nobody else can bet.
     *  Open Issue: is A2345 a valid straight?
